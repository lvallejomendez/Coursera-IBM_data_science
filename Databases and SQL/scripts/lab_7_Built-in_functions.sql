-- Exercise 2: Aggregate Functions
SELECT *

-- Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all 
-- animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
SELECT SUM(COST)

-- Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal 
-- rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST

-- Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals 
-- rescued.

-- in uppercase.

-- in uppercase without duplications.

-- table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the
-- query.
